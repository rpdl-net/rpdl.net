## What is rpdl.net?
Downloading Ren'Py/RPGM/Unity/Unreal/HTML games can be an annoying affair. Filehosts riddled with Ads, slow/throttled downloads and confusing naming schemes. **We're fixing all that**.  

## What do we do?
We take publicly available releases of new games, virus scan them and package them as torrents - for free.  

1. We create and host torrent files.
2. We update our catalogue several times a day. 
3. We take suggestions/feedback/requests on [our discord](/discord/) and on [our f95zone thread](https://f95zone.to/threads/discussion-questions-about-my-torrents.96535/)  
4. We do **not** modify the core game in any way and we do not fix bugs.  
5. We do **not** host or link to any mods.  

## Where do the donations go?

All donations go towards our server bills. We update our costs on our [donation page](/donate/)
