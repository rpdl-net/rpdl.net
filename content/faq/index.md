# Frequently asked questions

1. I keep getting kicked out of discord.

We use a [captcha bot](https://captcha.bot/) to verify users. You need to allow DM's and solve a captcha and you'll be all set.

2. The torrent doesn't start downloading.

You need to create an account and login, _then_ download the torrent and it will work as normal.  
Use dummy-data when signing up. We scramble email addresses and don't validate them.

3. You're a developer and:
    1. You'd like the `developer` role on discord.
    2. The information (Patreon etc) is out of date or missing.
    3. You'd like to forward us new builds or add your game.
    4. You'd like us to _remove_ your game from our index.
