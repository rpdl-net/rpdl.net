After much consideration, I'm ending compatibiltiy for MacOS.  

This hurts because I was hoping to be all-inclusive, however I couldn't in-good-faith continue with the previous package workflow. In short, it's simply too buggy and it's unfair for people to download games (some as big as 20gb) only to have issues running it on their OS.  

Additionally, I can't afford to create single torrents for MacOS specific releases as it'd be doubling disk-usage, it's just not practical.  

Thanks so much to the people on F95Zone who helped me debug & troubleshoot, you guys are awesome.
