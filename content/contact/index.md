We have a discord available [here](/discord) and my (rpdl#6652) DM's are open. If you'd prefer, you can also {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="mailto: admin@rpdl.net">email me</a>{{< /rawhtml >}}

If you're a developer and:

1. You'd like us to distribute public releases of your game.
2. The patreon link on the page for your game is wrong.
3. You'd like us to *remove* a game from our site.

Feel free to reach out via {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="mailto: admin@rpdl.net">email</a>{{< /rawhtml >}}- I usually reply pretty quickly.  
Please note, our goal isn't to profit directly off the content here - we actually run at a loss.  
We're perfectly happy to work with developers and respect their wishes - just let us know.  
Additionally, _all_ of our content is sourced from publicly available links!

If you're a user and:

1. You find a broken link, or something out of date.
2. You have suggestions or feedback.

Please reach out via [discord](/discord) first, I'll always reply!
