You got sent to this page because the site you were using is cross-posting torrents created for `rpdl.net`.  
While doing so, you'll often get spammed with shitty and malicious advertisements and popunders.   

This is unacceptable to us and it has nothing to do with our site, `rpdl.net`.  
As such, we redirect the users of those sites to this page so you're aware and can make your own informed decision.

Feel free to use this site and download any torrents you wish, there are no ads of any type, we're entirely [crowdfunded](/donate/). If you like it, you're welcome to join us on [Discord](/discord/) where torrents get posted earlier.

If you insist on using the site that sent you here, we suggest installing an ad-blocker to protect yourself.

If you're a site-owner, chances are I already emailed you and you ignored it.  
If you think we got it wrong, feel free to [reach out](/contact).
