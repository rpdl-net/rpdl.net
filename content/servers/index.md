We utilise a bunch of different providers to get files to you quickly. If you'd like to contribute and help us pay our bills at the same time, we have some affiliate links!

## Frantech/BuyVM

[Frantech/Buyvm](/frantech/) are the cheapest option. They have fantastic support and only use the best hardware. If you just need something small for light work, they'll be your best bet.

## Walker Servers

[Walker Servers](/walker/) specialise in dedicated servers. It's more expensive, but you'll be the only user. Their Leaseweb offerings offer the best efficiency and huge (100tb) bandwidth limits.

## Hetzner

[Hetzner](/hetzner/) are also dedicated, but you're dealing directly with the provider. Hetzner dedicated servers are also _unlimited traffic_. If you want an AMD Ryzen machine with a dedicated gigabit uplink, Hetzner is the best choice.

## Hetrix

We use [Hetrix](/hetrix/) as our third party status monitor. If you join via our referral you get extra blacklist/status/uptime monitor checks too!
